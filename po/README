If you checked out this source tree directly from holy Git, you might be
wondering where are the POT and PO files.  Here are some instructions
that will hopefully clarify the situation.

  - If you're a user or a distributor, simply fill the po directory by
    importing translations from the Translation Project:

    	 ./linguas.sh

    holy's build system will automatically detect those and include them
    in your install.
