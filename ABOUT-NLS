To translate code, run ./configure --with-included-gettext
    this will imply as much multi-language support as possible,
    note that ALL the language translations are done via AI,
    credits goes to Deepseek, ChatGPT, Gemini and Copilot.
    Translating english to arabic for instance is super hard for
    the author (since he only knows 2 languages). And the translations 
    are applied via gettext.

    To disable / skip including translations when building, run 
        ./configure --disable-nls
